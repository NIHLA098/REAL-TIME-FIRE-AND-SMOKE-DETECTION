# REAL-TIME-FIRE-AND-SMOKE-DETECTION
This project implements a real-time fire and smoke detection system using Python and OpenCV. It processes video input from a webcam or video file to identify potential fire and smoke regions based on color, motion, and texture analysis. The goal is to provide a lightweight, real-time surveillance solution for fire hazard detection.
